![Good Morning!](http://i.imgur.com/bqA1MYr.png)

A rather gimmicky discord bot for the associated Famicom/FamiTracker communities.

Made with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), based on [Kurisu](https://github.com/916253/Kurisu), a Discord server bot by [916253](https://github.com/916253) and [ihaveamac/ihaveahax](https://github.com/ihaveamac).
